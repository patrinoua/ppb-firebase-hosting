      <h3>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.</h3>
      <h4>Registration Information</h4>

      collect certain information ("Registration Information") about you, such
      as:

      </ul>
      <p>
        Login information and friend lists for social media accounts that you
        connect to your PingPongBuddies Account (this could include, for
        example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts ("Social Media Accounts").
        You will also be required to create a password in connection with the
        registration of your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you register, you will be able to review and change this
        information at any time by accessing your “Profile” page! You control
        your user profile and are able to correct or update (other than your
        email address, cell phone number, date of birth, gender and location
        (which is automatically updated)) your information at any time by just
        logging in to PingPongBuddies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our
        Users. Registration Information such as your name and username may be
        visible to the public on your profile page.
      </p>
      <h4>Additional Information</h4>
      <p>
        We may ask you to provide your full name, address and email address.
        Such details may be shared with third parties for purposes relating to,
        for example, any of our loyalty programs, sending gifts or delivery of
        merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect additional information in connection with your use
        of PingPongBuddies, for example if you use our messaging function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your email
        address, and may track your IP address as well as the information you
        send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our
        communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from
        you about other Users (and from other Users about you).
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully
        about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not
        recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details,
        phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national
        identity numbers, drivers' license details and other sensitive
        information on your profile which is open to abuse and misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your
        profile such as your religious denomination and health details. You may
        also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when you add
        certain PingPongBuddies Badges to your profile, such as your religion
        and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this
        information to us when you create your profile, there is no requirement
        to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on
        PingPongBuddies may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you
        do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself,
        including through adding certain Badges to your profile, you are
        explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making
        this public to other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function,
        the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please
        see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post
        on PingPongBuddies. If you post anything that is inconsistent with our
        Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate your
        Account - we really don't want to have to do this so please play by the
        rules!
      </p>
      <p>
        For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user
        experience, we might ask users to verify their accounts and might ask
        for your phone number. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we
        also want to avoid fake PingPongBuddies accounts being created which can
        be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the
        PingPongBuddies network and spoil things for everyone. We use a third
        party provider for account verification who will keep your phone number
        for up to 90 days for fraud identification purposes. We collect and use
        your phone number on the basis of our legitimate interests identified in
        section 11 below and for the prevention of fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept
        up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update
        this in your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent abuse of the app/site, PingPongBuddies uses automated
        decisions and moderators to block accounts as part of its moderation
        procedures. In order to do this, we check accounts and messages for
        content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. This
        is done through a combination of automated systems and our team of
        moderators. If an account or message meets certain criteria that
        demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been
        breached, the relevant account will automatically be blocked. All users
        of accounts that have been blocked will be notified that their account
        has been blocked and affected users can contact PingPongBuddies to
        contest the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        PingPongBuddies also uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent
        payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud
        procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions
        for behavior that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use.
        If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms
        and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the
        transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may
        automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will
        be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected
        users can contact PingPongBuddies to contest the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that if your account is blocked, any account(s) that you
        have on our other group platforms/applications may also be blocked as
        part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process
        your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of
        fraud and for audit/tax purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We process some limited data (demographics and information that you have
        optionally provided us with via PingPongBuddies Badges) to drive
        targeted advertising in our legitimate interest, via promo cards and ads
        on our App. We also process limited data (device identifiers) and share
        this with third party advertising networks which host our ads. You can
        stop targeted advertising within the “Contact & FAQ” page accessible via
        your profile. If you opt-out of targeted advertising you will still see
        adverts though they will be less relevant to you. Through your device’s
        security settings you also have the option to prevent or limit device
        identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is
        made of the device identifiers. If you would like more information about
        this practice and to know your choices about not having this information
        used by these companies, please visit this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about
        the great promotions and offers we have available. If you’ve told us
        it’s OK, we will use your email address and phone number to send you
        information on these. You can withdraw this consent at any time via
        Settings in the App.
      </p>
      <h4>Geolocation Information</h4>
      <p>
        If you turn these features on, when you use your cell phone, we will
        collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location
        information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device's
        coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us
        identify your physical location and we may use it to personalize the App
        and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the
        information to be displayed and shared with other members choosing to
        view “nearby” posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn it off, you can
        do so by the following methods:
      </p>
      <p>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, PingPongBuddies</p>
      <p>
        Android — settings, location, PingPongBuddies, permissions, location
      </p>
      <h4>Log and Usage Data</h4>
      <p>
        We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
        legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of
        your account (following the safety retention window), unless:
      </p>
      <p>
        we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some
        “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data
        retention obligations); we must keep it to evidence our compliance with
        applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy
        Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years); there is an
        outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant
        information until it is resolved; or the information must be kept for
        our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and
        enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need
        to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or
        security incidents from opening a new account. Where PingPongBuddies
        uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent
        fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and prevent spam
        communications on the App (as explained above), we may need to keep
        personal information for a longer period than the retention periods
        explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly. Where
        this is the case, we always seek to minimize the amount of personal
        information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept
        securely from other user personal information. We regularly review the
        period for which personal information is required for machine learning
        purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer
        required.
      </p>
      <h4>Device Information</h4>
      <p>
        We may collect information about your device when you use the App
        including the unique device identifier, device model, operating system,
        and MAC address. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may
        access your device's address book solely in order to add someone to your
        contacts.
      </p>
      <h4>Links</h4>
      <p>

        enquiries from within or outside your country of residence where we are
        required to by law, where there is an investigation into alleged
        criminal behaviour or to protect the vital interests of a person. This

      <h4>4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.</h4>
      <p>
        We think our PingPongBuddies are awesome, and we want you to share how
        awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to
        enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect
        with other Users and to interact with them. If you register or log in to
        the App using your Facebook account, you are authorizing us to access
        certain Facebook account information, including information you make
        available via Facebook, your friends list, current location and those
        friends you have in common with other PingPongBuddies. You also
        understand that your PingPongBuddies profile and other information you
        make available via the App, including information you provide directly
        or indirectly through Facebook (i.e., your Facebook photos, your name,
        age, approximate location, friends you have in common with other
        PingPongBuddies and other profile information), may be viewed and shared
        by PingPongBuddies with individuals who may or may not be Users or via
        third party applications in such PingPongBuddies’ discretion. For
        example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook
        friends by sharing your picture, regardless of whether such friend(s) is
        also a User of the App. You might share information like the photos and
        messages you send or upload and any metadata provided with those
        messages, along with any comments or information you provide in
        connection with your photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using PingPongBuddies, you should assume that anything you post or
        submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users
        of the App and non-Users of the App. We want our PingPongBuddies to be
        careful about posting information that will eventually be made public.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you log in to or access PingPongBuddies through your Facebook
        profile, remember to log off Facebook when you leave a device in order
        to prevent other users from accessing your account.
      </p>
      <h4>5. MODIFYING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.</h4>
      <p>
        You may access or modify the Registration Information you provided at
        any time or permanently delete your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make
        sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up to 30 days it is still
        possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully
        deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your
        Account from our systems. We are not responsible for any information,
        pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems
        resulting from the deactivation of your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent abuse and/or misuse of PingPongBuddies by a User following
        termination or deletion of a profile/Account we shall retain such
        information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure
        that User does not open a new Account and profile in breach of our Terms
        and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete
        your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or
        accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with
        others, or copied or stored by other Users or to the extent such
        information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this,
        nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party
        applications or websites access to your personal information they may
        retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of
        service or privacy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to
        30 days to enable restoration, but will not be available to others in
        the meantime.
      </p>
      <h4>6. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.</h4>
      <p>
        Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you
        have to be at least 18 years old to use the App - sorry kids, we know
        PingPongBuddies is cool, but you'll have to come back when you're old
        enough!
      </p>
      <p>
        PingPongBuddies does not knowingly collect any information about or
        market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are
        less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to
        us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18
        has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we
        will take steps to terminate that person's registration and delete their
        Registration Information from PingPongBuddies. If we do delete a profile
        because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and
        IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by
        creating a new profile.
      </p>
      <h4>7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.</h4>
      <p>
        As PingPongBuddies evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time
        to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of
        your information and will always be at PingPongBuddies.com/privacy/. If
        we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is
        material, we will notify you, for example, via an email to the email
        associated with your Account or by posting a notice within
        PingPongBuddies. By continuing to access or use the App after those
        changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>
      <h4>8. SECURITY.</h4>
      <p>
        Here at PingPongBuddies we pride ourselves on taking commercially
        reasonable security measures to help protect your information against
        loss, misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. We use reasonable
        security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal
        information such as secured servers using firewalls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately no website or Internet transmission is ever completely
        100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access,
        hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some
        handy tips to help keep your data secure:
      </p>
      <p>
        Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know
        who may stumble onto your Account! Please don't share your social media
        password with anyone else! Change your social media password
        periodically.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ever think someone has had access to your social media password,
        please report it to the relevant social media platform and change your
        password immediately. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal
        data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is
        at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECURITY, DAMAGE TO YOUR
        DEVICE, OR ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION
        OR OTHER DATA.
      </p>
      <h4>9. THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS.</h4>
      <p>
        If you have registered with PingPongBuddies using a third party social
        media platform, such as Facebook, your PingPongBuddies profile will be
        available to all Users of PingPongBuddies whether via our App or our
        partners' websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that when you register with a third party, you are also giving
        them personal information, so we recommend that you read their privacy
        policies as PingPongBuddies does not control how they use their
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have registered on one of these third party websites, such as
        Facebook, or you have verified your Account via a third party website,
        we may connect your PingPongBuddies profile with your profile on such
        website. We may do this by way of new products and applications which we
        introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group
        companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have created a PingPongBuddies profile through a third party
        website and you do not want to link your PingPongBuddies profile to your
        profile on the third party website, PingPongBuddies cannot amend these
        settings. Please visit the application settings on your third party
        website profile and follow the instructions to remove the
        PingPongBuddies access permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only use the APIs, OAuth Tokens, Widgets, or other means provided by
        the applicable Social Media Account to integrate your Social Media
        Account with our App. As such, we only receive the limited information
        that each Social Media Account permits to be transferred.
      </p>
      <h4>10. YOUR UK AND EU RIGHTS.</h4>
      <p>
        Under UK and EU law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with data
        protection regulators, and the Information Commissioners’ Office (ICO)
        is the UK’s lead regulator. You can find out how to raise a concern with
        the ICO by visiting their website at www.ico.org.uk. If you’re within
        the EU, you may also get in touch with your local Data Protection
        Regulator who may liaise with the ICO on your behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a number of rights under European Data Protection law as
        detailed below. These rights apply to all of our users:
      </p>
      <p>
        Right to be informed: what personal data an organisation is processing
        and why (we provide this information to you in this Privacy Policy).
        Right of access: you can request a copy of your data. Right of
        rectification: if the data held is inaccurate, you have the right to
        have it corrected. Right to erasure: you have the right to have your
        data deleted in certain circumstances. Right to restrict processing: in
        limited circumstances, you have the right to request that processing is
        stopped but the data retained. Right to data portability: you can
        request a copy of your data in a machine-readable form that can be
        transferred to another provider. Right to object: in certain
        circumstances (including where data is processed on the basis of
        legitimate interests or for the purposes of marketing) you may object to
        that processing. Rights related to automated decision making including
        profiling: there are several rights in this area where processing
        carried out on a solely automated basis results in a decision which has
        legal or significant effects for the individual. In these circumstances
        your rights include the right to ensure that there is human intervention
        in the decision-making process. PingPongBuddies has designated a Data
        Protection Officer and they can be reached by emailing
        pingponistas@gmail.com
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our
        Feedback Page or email us at pingponistas@gmail.com. You can also
        contact us by post at the address above.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does PingPongBuddies protect my personal data? PingPongBuddies has
        implemented appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the
        loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control,
        including your personal data. Our technical experts at PingPongBuddies
        work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches
        of our website, member database and records, no website or Internet
        transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that
        unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never
        occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal data safe
        (including your password) and to log out of your account after use. If
        you lose your password or give it out, or another service provider that
        you use suffers a data breach and you have used the same credentials
        with that service provider as you have with PingPongBuddies, your
        personal data may be compromised. If that happens, please report it to
        Support via our Feedback Page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where is my personal data kept? We want you to be able to access
        PingPongBuddies wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to
        provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including
        in the US, Hong Kong, Czech Republic and Russia. The hardware is located
        in third-party data centres but is owned by the PingPongBuddies group.
        Data collected by advertising partners may also be held outside the
        European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected
        by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such as: EU
        approved model clauses (which can be found here), US privacy shield
        certification (more information can be found here – please note that
        PingPongBuddies is not Privacy Shield certified but we may pass
        information to third party service providers or advertising partners who
        are based in the US and who are Privacy Shield certified); and
        implementing robust contractual standards. If you want more information
        relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place, please email
        pingponistas@gmail.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does PingPongBuddies collect any other personal data about me? If you
        contact our Customer Support team via our Feedback Page, we will receive
        your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as the

        records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we
        receive from you about other users (and from other users about you) for
        2 years after deletion of your account.

        Does PingPongBuddies use my personal data for any other purpose? We may
        use material that you post on the open access areas of PingPongBuddies
        in advertising and promotional materials on our partner sites and
        partner products. We believe these uses are in line with our legitimate
        interests in enabling us to improve our site and better tailor your
        online experience to meet your needs. If we intend to do this, we will
        contact you for your prior approval.

      <p>
        From time to time we may run surveys for research purposes and we may
        contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also
        contact you to find out if you would like to take part in marketing
        campaigns. Such surveys and marketing campaigns are optional and more
